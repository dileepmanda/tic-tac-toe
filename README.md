# tic-tac-toe
small AS simple game
Tic-Tac-Toe, noughts and crosses or xyz (in your language) is more fun to play when you yourself code it.
I'm thrilled to share that I have been a part of #devtown boot-camp where I successfully coded the Tic-Tac-Toe game using #python. Minmax algorithm using the backtracking technique helped me get through the code. In this #artificialintelligence has been designed which plays against you in case of a single player.
So what do you think, should we team up against Al?
Let the game begin!
